This section explains how to create a new agent using data
sent from the frontend and storing it in the database.
The process involves sending a POST request to the backend,
which creates the agent and returns a JSON response with the newly created agent's details.

<Code code='POST /api/agents' title='Endpoint' mark='POST' />

<Tabs class='mt-10'>
    <TabItem label='cURL'>
        <Code
            lang='sh'
            code='curl http://osticket.homestead.local/api/agents -u "email:password"'
        />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label='PHP'>
        <Code lang='shell' code='POST /api/agents' />
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Request Body
