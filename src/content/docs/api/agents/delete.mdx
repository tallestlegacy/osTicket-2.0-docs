This section explains how to delete a specific agent by its id.
A <code><strong>DELETE</strong></code> request is sent to the backend, which removes the agent
from the database and returns a confirmation response.

<Code code='DELETE /api/agents/:id' title='Endpoint' mark='DELETE' />

<code>:id</code>: The unique identifier of the agent you wish to retrieve.

### Steps to Delete an Agent

<Steps>

1. <strong>Send a DELETE Request with Agent ID</strong>

    - Send a DELETE request to the /api/agents/:id endpoint, where :id is the unique identifier of the agent you want to delete.

2. <strong>Backend Validates the Request</strong>

    - The backend receives the request and checks whether an agent with the provided id exists in the system.

3. <strong>Backend Deletes the Agent</strong>

    - If the agent exists, the backend proceeds to delete the agent from the database.

4. <strong>Response</strong>

    - If the deletion is successful, the backend returns a JSON response confirming the deletion.

</Steps>

##### Response example

```json
{
    "message": "Agent with ID '12345' successfully deleted."
}
```
