This section explains how to create a new team using data
sent from the frontend and storing it in the database.
The process involves sending a <code><strong>POST</strong></code> request to the backend,
which creates the team and returns a JSON response with the newly created team's details.

<Code code='POST /api/teams' title='Endpoint' mark='POST' />

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label='cURL'>
        <Code lang='sh' code='curl http://osticket.homestead.local/api/teams -u "email:password"' />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label='PHP'>
        <Code lang='shell' code='POST /api/teams' />
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Below is an example of the required fields:
