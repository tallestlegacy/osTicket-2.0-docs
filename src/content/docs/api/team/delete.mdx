This section explains how to delete a specific team by its <code>id</code>.
A <code><strong>DELETE</strong></code> request is sent to the backend, which removes the team
from the database and returns a confirmation response.

<Code code='DELETE /api/teams/:id' title='Endpoint' mark='DELETE' />

<code>:id</code>: The unique identifier of the team you wish to retrieve.

### Steps to Delete a team

<Steps>

1. <strong>Send a DELETE Request with team ID</strong>

    - Send a DELETE request to the /api/teams/:id endpoint, where :id is the unique identifier of the team you want to delete.

2. <strong>Backend Validates the Request</strong>

    - The backend receives the request and checks whether a team with the provided id exists in the system.

3. <strong>Backend Deletes the team</strong>

    - If the team exists, the backend proceeds to delete the team from the database.

4. <strong>Response</strong>

    - If the deletion is successful, the backend returns a JSON response confirming the deletion.

</Steps>

##### Response example

```json
{
    "message": "team with ID '12345' successfully deleted."
}
```
