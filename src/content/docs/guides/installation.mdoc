### Install parallels desktop

First, ensure that you have Parallels Desktop installed on your Mac. You can download it from the [parallels website](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/)

### Install vagrant

If you haven't already installed Vagrant, you can download and install it use the following commands to install it.

```sh
$ brew tap hashicorp/tap
$ brew install hashicorp/tap/hashicorp-vagrant
```

After installing Vagrant, you can verify the installation by running:

```sh
$ vagrant --version
```

### Install the parallels provider plugin for vagrant

Since the Parallels provider is a Vagrant plugin, installing it is easy just run the command:

```sh
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-parallels
```

Update the provider

```sh
$ vagrant plugin update vagrant-parallels
```

To uninstall run:

```sh
$ vagrant plugin uninstall vagrant-parallels
```

### Create or Modify a Vagrantfile to use parallels

Optional since Homestead will contain this files (Skip this step)

Here is an example of how to configure the Vagrantfile to use Parallels as the provider:

```php
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

    config.vm.provider "parallels" do |prl|
        prl.memory = 2048 # Amount of memory to allocate to the VM (optional)
        prl.cpus = 2 # Number of CPUs to allocate to the VM (optional)
    end

end
```
  

In this example:

-   The config.vm.provider "parallels" block specifies the Parallels provider.
    
-   You can configure various options inside the block, like memory, CPUs, etc.
    

### Initialize the vagrant environment if you havenâ€™t created a vagrantfile yet

Initialize a new Vagrant project with the following command:

```sh
$ vagrant init
```

Then, edit the generated Vagrantfile to include the Parallels provider configuration as shown above.

### Start the VM using parallels

If you have a multi-provider configuration and/or want to be sure that exactly parallels provider will be used, then you can specify it explicitly:

```sh
$ vagrant up --provider=parallels
```

This will instruct Vagrant to use Parallels to create and start the virtual machine.

### Additional configurations

You can add additional configurations to your Vagrantfile, such as port forwarding, network settings, or shared folders, depending on your needs.

Access the VM with the following commands

```sh
$ vagrant ssh
```

Stop the VM with the following commands:

```sh
$ vagrant halt
```
